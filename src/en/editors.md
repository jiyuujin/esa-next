## Pair Programming

Among them, especially for IntelliJ plugin Floobits, there is a limit of 5 free tier private repositories

Get a Floobits account in advance and set the Workspace URL as `https://floobits.com/<username>/<repository name>` as soon as you get an account

1. [VSCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ja/services/live-share/)
2. [IntelliJ](https://floobits.com/help/plugins/intellij)
3. [PHPStorm](https://pleiades.io/help/phpstorm/live-edit.html)

It is very meaningful to be able to use it as a web editor.

If you use IntelliJ with each other, you can operate it from a web browser such as Chrome by setting the URL.
